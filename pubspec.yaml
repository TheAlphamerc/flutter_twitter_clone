# The following section is specific to Flutter.
flutter:
  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/images/icon-48.png
    - assets/images/icon-480.png
    - assets/images/icon-400.png
    - assets/images/qr.png
    - assets/images/bulb.png
    - assets/images/google_logo.png
    - assets/images/error_image.png

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: TwitterIcon
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/icons.ttf
    - family: HelveticaNeue
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/HelveticaNeue.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/HelveticaNeue400.ttf
          weight: 400
        - asset: assets/fonts/HelveticaNeue500.ttf
          weight: 500
        - asset: assets/fonts/HelveticaNeue600.ttf
          weight: 600
        - asset: assets/fonts/HelveticaNeue700.ttf
          weight: 700
        - asset: assets/fonts/HelveticaNeue800.ttf
          weight: 800
        - asset: assets/fonts/HelveticaNeue900.ttf
          weight: 900
        - asset: assets/fonts/HelveticaNeueIt.ttf
          style: italic

  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
