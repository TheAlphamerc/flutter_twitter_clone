# Contributing Guide

Fwitter app is Open Source! I love it when people contribute!

## Getting Started

- Make sure you have a [GitHub Account](https://github.com/signup/free).
- Make sure the [Dart SDK](https://www.dartlang.org/tools/sdk/) is installed on your system.
- Make sure you have [Git](http://git-scm.com/) installed on your system.
- [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) the [repository](https://github.com/SpinlockLabs/github.dart) on GitHub.

## Making Changes

- [Clone the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) to open it on your code editor.
- [Create a branch](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository) for your changes.
- [Commit your code](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Basics-Recording-Changes-to-the-Repository) for each logical change (see [tips for creating better commit messages](http://robots.thoughtbot.com/5-useful-tips-for-a-better-commit-message)).
- [Push your change](https://help.github.com/articles/pushing-to-a-remote) to your fork.
- [Create a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request) on GitHub for your change.
- Wait for reviewers to give feedback.
- When the reviewers think that the Pull Request is ready, they will merge it.

## Code Style

Fwitter follows the [Dart Style Guide](https://www.dartlang.org/articles/style-guide/). Please note that if your code is not formatted according to the guide as much as possible, we will reject your Pull Request until it is fixed. Some things such as long lines will generally be accepted, however try to make it smaller if possible.

## Efficiency

Fwitter is committed to efficiency as much as possible. If your code is not efficient, then we will probably reject your Pull Request.

## Rejections

Pull Request rejections are not bad things. It just means you need to fix something. Perhaps it is important to define 'rejection' as it is used in this case. A rejection is when a Fwitter committer comments on a Pull Request with a comment like 'rejected due to incorrect formatting'.
